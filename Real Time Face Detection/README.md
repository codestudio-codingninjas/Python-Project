## About
Real-Time Face Detection is a simple Python application that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video from the webcam and detects faces in the video stream. It draws rectangles around the detected faces in real-time.

## Guided Path

Check out our guided path on Real-Time Face Detection for more information on the development process and our thoughts on building the application:

* [Real-Time Face Detection Using Python](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/guided-paths/python-projects/content/577061/offering/8920010).

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV library (install using `pip install opencv-python`)

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook.
* Then navigate to the cloned repository.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script to start the real-time face detection application.
2. The application will access your webcam and display the video stream with rectangles around detected faces.
3. Press 'q' to stop the application and close the window.

## Have Fun Detecting Faces!

Enjoy real-time face detection with this simple Python application using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. Have fun detecting faces in the video stream from your webcam!
