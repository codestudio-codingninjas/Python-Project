## About

2048 is a popular single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when the player achieves this number. The game board is a 4x4 grid, and the player can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. New tiles with the numbers 2 or 4 are added to the board after each move. The game is over when there are no valid moves left.

## Guided Path

Check out our guided path on 2048 Game for more information on the development process:

* [2048 Game in Python](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/guided-paths/python-projects/content/577067/offering/8951979).

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook.
* Then navigate to the cloned repository.

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys to move the tiles in the respective direction: up, down, left, and right.
2. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide.
3. After each move, a new tile with either number 2 or 4 will appear on the board.
4. The goal is to get the number 2048 by merging tiles with the same number.
5. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
6. The game is over when there are no valid moves left and the board is full.

## How to Win

To win the 2048 game, combine tiles strategically to reach the number 2048. Here are some tips to improve your chances of winning:

- Focus on creating larger tiles: Try to merge tiles with the same number to form larger tiles. This will free up space and make it easier to continue merging tiles.
- Keep the larger numbers in one corner: Try to keep the larger tiles in one corner of the board, and build around them. This will prevent large tiles from getting isolated and make it easier to merge them.
- Plan your moves: Think ahead and plan your moves to avoid getting stuck with no valid moves. Avoid moving tiles in a way that blocks potential mergers.
