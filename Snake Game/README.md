## About

The Snake Game is a classic single-player game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the borders of the game board or the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. The game is over if the snake collides with the borders or its own body.

## Guided Path

# Check out our guided path on the Snake Game for more information on the development process and our thoughts on building the Snake Game:

* [Snake Game Using Python](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/guided-paths/python-projects/content/577065/offering/8951970).

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. Turtle graphics library (which is usually included with Python)

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook.
* Then navigate to the cloned repository.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the snake: Up (↑) to go up, Down (↓) to go down, Left (←) to go left, and Right (→) to go right.
2. The snake will move continuously in the direction you choose until you change it.
3. The goal is to eat the food (red circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the borders of the game board or the snake's own body, as it will end the game.
5. As you eat more food, the snake will grow longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible and beat your previous high score!
